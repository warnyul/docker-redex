Docker image for [Facebook's ReDex](https://fbredex.com) Android Bytecode Optimizer.

## Usage

You can run ReDex with a single command:
```
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":"$(pwd)" -w "$(pwd)" warnyul/redex redex -o ./redex.apk ./myapp.apk
```

If you would like to pass `android.jar` or `proguard` files to redex, you could do it without install the SDK on your machine.
You can find Android SDK in /opt/android-sdk-linux folder

```
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":"$(pwd)" -w "$(pwd)" warnyul/redex redex \
   -o ./redex.apk \
   -j /opt/android-sdk-linux/platforms/android-29/android.jar \
   -P /opt/android-sdk-linux/tools/proguard/proguard-android-optimize.txt \
   ./myapp.apk
```

## Build

```
git clone https://github.com/warnyul/docker-redex.git
cd docker-redex
# Use -u to update redex to the latest commit before build it.
./build.sh -u
```

All image will be tagged with the redex's commit hash to identify builds.
